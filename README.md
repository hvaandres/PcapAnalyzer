- If your file is big and you want to extract the data from it, you can also change the number of packets to be read in the code if you want to analyze a specific number of packets. For example, if you want to analyze the first 20 packets, you can change the code to:

```
for packet in packets[:20]:
        analyze_http_packet(packet, report_file)
```
